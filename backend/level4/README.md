# Level 4

Our (fictionnal) business model is to price our service 5% on each shift.
In addition to that we also help the hospitals to fill in unassigned shifts with interim workers.

An interim is paid 480 € per shift.
We also take a fixed fee of 80 € on each shift for which we provided an interim worker.

Adapt the price computation to take these new rules into account and to calculate our commission.
